Welcome to the Crafty tutorail section. This is very much a work in progress. You can find already written chapters to the left. Please help out by forking https://github.com/craftyjs/craftyjs.github.com


The proposed way to structure the tutorials is to explain only one topic in each chapter. If other (perhaps more advanced) parts of Crafty are required to aid in examples and text, a reference should be given to a chapter explaining the topic in detail, and a simple explanation can be given in place.
